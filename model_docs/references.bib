    abstract = {Today's decision-makers rely heavily on Integrated Assessment Models to guide the decarbonisation of the energy system. Uncertainty is embedded in the assumptions these models are built upon. Unless those uncertainties are adequately assessed, using Integrated Assessment Models for policy design is unadvised. In this work we run Monte Carlo simulations with the MEDEAS model at European Union scale to assess how the uncertainties on the main drivers of the transition affect key socioeconomic and environmental indicators. In addition, One-at-a-time sensitivity exploration is performed to grade the contribution of a set of model parameters to the uncertainty in the same key indicators. The combination of the uncertainties in the model drivers magnify the uncertainty in the model outputs, which widens over time. Parameters affecting sectorial and households' energy efficiency and households' transport energy use ranked amongst the most impacting ones on simulation results.}

    abstract = {We present a baseline stochastic framework for assessing inter-sectorial relationships in a generic economy. We show that - irrespective of the specific features of the technology matrix for a given country or a particular year - the Leontief multipliers (and any upstreamness/downstreamness indicator computed from the Leontief inverse matrix) follow a universal pattern, which we characterize analytically. We formulate a universal benchmark to assess the structural inter-dependence of sectors in a generic economy. Several empirical results on World Input-Output Database (WIOD, 2013 Release) are presented that corroborate our findings.},

At such high levels of renewable electricity generation, the unique characteristics of some renewable resources, specifically geographical distribution and variability and uncertainty in output, pose challenges to the operability of the nation's electric system.},
